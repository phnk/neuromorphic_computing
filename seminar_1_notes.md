# Seminar 1 - Learning approcahes
Motivation: Reponse amplitute not fixed but can change over time. Synaptic plasticity.

## Supervised Learning
* Spike Layer Error Reassignment (SLAYER)

* Hebbian Learning (Correlation-based learning)
	- Hebbian learning is unsupervised as there is no noting of 'good' and 'bad' changes of a synapse.
	- STDP
		- "The synapse is strengthened if the presynaptic spike occurs shortly before the postsynaptic neuron fires, but the synapse is weakened if the sequence of spikes is reversed" [1]
		- "With STDP, repeated presynaptic spike arrival a few milliseconds before postsynaptic action potentials leads in many synapse types to Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) of the synapses, whereas repeated spike arrival after postsynaptic spikes leads to Long-Term Depression (LTD) of the same synapse" [2]


## Unsupervised Learning

## Reward based learning
