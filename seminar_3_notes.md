# Seminar 3

## How was the video?
Generally good.
Historical timeline was really good.

SNN vs ANN? What is the difference?


## Seminars

### Brain
How do they estimate the number of neurons and synapses?

### Von Neumann vs. Neuromoprhic
 * Focus: Carver Mead paper "Neuromorphic Electronic Systems".
 * Drawing from first principals in physics and electronics. He argues that we need this for energy optimization.
 * A reasonable figure for energy decrease from NC 10^4
 * Basic Von Neumann architecture
	- Inheriently clock driven
	- Inherinently synchronous
 * Von Neumann bottleneck
	- Seperate processing and memory
 * Neuromorphic Architecture
	- In memory processing
	- We care about timings, rather than numbers
	- Event-based and parallel
	- Analog not digital
	- Generate exponentials from the physics of the processor itself
